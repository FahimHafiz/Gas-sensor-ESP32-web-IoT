# Gas Sensor Data Logging with ESP32 and XAMPP

## Overview
In this repository, we explore how to read data from an MQ-2 gas sensor using an ESP32 microcontroller, convert the analog readings to an approximate PPM (parts per million) value, and store the data in a local database using XAMPP. This project provides a hands-on approach to IoT by integrating hardware (ESP32, MQ-2 sensor) with software (PHP, MySQL) to demonstrate a basic IoT-based gas monitoring system.

### Repository Sections
1. [**Sensor Data Acquisition**](docs/how_to_read_sensor.md) - Guide to reading analog data from the MQ-2 gas sensor, converting it to PPM, and connecting the hardware components.
2. [**XAMPP Introduction**](docs/xampp_intro.md) - Overview of XAMPP for managing databases locally.
3. [**Database Integration**](docs/database_integration.md) - Step-by-step instructions for creating a database in XAMPP, writing a PHP script to store data, and integrating the ESP32 with the database.
