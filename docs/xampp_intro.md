# IoT Cloud Using XAMPP

## Overview
Sending Gas PPM data from the ESP32 to a local server using XAMPP, a free and open-source tool for creating and testing websites on a local computer.

## Components of XAMPP
1. **Apache**: Serves web pages. When you visit a website, Apache sends the requested pages to your browser.
2. **MariaDB**: Manages website data. Stores information like product details, customer info, and order histories.
3. **PHP and Perl**: Server-side scripting languages. They create dynamic web pages.

## What is XAMPP?
- **XAMPP**: Cross-Platform, Apache, MySQL, PHP, and Perl.
- **Easy to Use**: Ideal for beginners to test and ensure websites work properly before going live.

## Core Functions
1. **Apache**:
   - **Role**: Web server software that handles requests and delivers web pages.
   - **Example**: Visiting "www.example.com" to see the site content.
2. **MySQL**:
   - **Role**: Database management, storing and managing website data.
   - **Example**: Storing product details and customer info for an online store.
3. **PHP**:
   - **Role**: Generates dynamic web pages from server-side scripts.
   - **Example**: Verifying login credentials and directing users to their accounts.

## Interaction in XAMPP
- **Apache**: Receives and handles web page requests.
- **MySQL**: Stores blog content and other data.
- **PHP**: Retrieves data from MySQL, formats it, and generates HTML for display.

Together, these components create a fully functional and interactive website environment.

For more details on how to install and integrate XAMPP, you can look at one of the experiments We designed (Me and my colleagues at UIU) in this following link: [View PDF](Exp2_IoT_ESP32.pdf)
